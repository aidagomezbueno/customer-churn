# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Overview
This project is a part of the "Data Analytics for Decision Making" course at IE School of Science & Technology, focusing on the prediction of customer churn using machine learning. Through extensive data analysis, cleaning, and application of predictive models, this project aims to uncover underlying patterns and factors contributing to customer churn.

## Dataset
The project utilizes two datasets:
- `cleaned_data.csv`: A preprocessed version of the original dataset, ready for analysis and modeling.
- `Group_4_dataset.csv`: The raw dataset containing customer information and their churn status.

Both datasets include various customer attributes, such as demographics, account details, and transaction history, which are instrumental in understanding and predicting churn.

## Structure
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial assessment of the data to understand the distributions, missing values, and potential correlations.
- **Data Cleaning**: Steps taken to prepare the data for modeling, including handling missing values, removing irrelevant features, and normalizing data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new features to improve model performance and insights into the data.
- **Model Building**: Application of various machine learning models to predict customer churn. The models are evaluated based on accuracy and the ability to generalize to unseen data.
- **Evaluation**: Use of accuracy metrics and cross-validation to assess model performance.

## Key Findings and Models
The project explores multiple models, with a detailed focus on their accuracy and feature importance. The analysis provides insights into which customer attributes are most indicative of churn, assisting in the development of targeted retention strategies.

This project highlights the importance of data analytics in decision-making processes, especially in predicting customer behavior. The findings can help businesses implement more effective retention strategies, ultimately reducing churn and fostering customer loyalty.
